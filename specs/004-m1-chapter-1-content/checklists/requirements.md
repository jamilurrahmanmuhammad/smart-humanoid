# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 Chapter 1 - Foundations of Physical AI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitution Compliance Validation

- [x] Constitution III (Anti-Convergence): Narrative approach, no lecture-style
- [x] Constitution V (Minimal Sufficient Content): "Try With AI" required
- [x] Constitution VI (Citation Requirements): IEEE citations required for factual claims
- [x] Constitution IX (Plagiarism Prevention): Original content requirement
- [x] Constitution XII (Personalization): Metadata requirements included
- [x] Constitution XXI (Translation Governance): Translation-ready requirement
- [x] Constitution XXXV (Domain Structure): Aligns with Module 1 scope
- [x] Constitution XXXVI (Chapter Structure): Learning objectives, prerequisites defined

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- No clarifications needed - requirements are derived from detailed ChatGPT specification
- Constitution compliance is explicit in functional requirements (FR-013 through FR-022)
