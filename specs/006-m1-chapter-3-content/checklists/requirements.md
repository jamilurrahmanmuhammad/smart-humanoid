# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 Chapter 3 - URDF Modeling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Items | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **PASS** |

## Notes

- Specification follows Constitution v1.2.0 requirements for three chapter variants
- All 38 functional requirements are testable and specific
- 13 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Clear out-of-scope boundaries prevent scope creep
- Ready to proceed with `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
