# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1! This module covers the foundational concepts of robotic nervous systems, including ROS (Robot Operating System) and the communication infrastructure that enables robots to sense and respond to their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture of robotic nervous systems
- Work with ROS 2 fundamentals
- Implement sensor-actuator communication patterns
- Build basic robotic control loops

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

This chapter establishes the conceptual foundation of Physical AI, introducing embodied intelligence, the perception-action loop, and why robots must understand physics.

**Choose your learning path:**

| Path | Level | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| [Explorer](./chapter-1-physical-ai-foundations-explorer) | Beginner | Software developers, simulation-focused learners |
| [Builder](./chapter-1-physical-ai-foundations-builder) | Intermediate | Makers, Arduino/Raspberry Pi enthusiasts |
| [Engineer](./chapter-1-physical-ai-foundations-engineer) | Advanced | Robotics professionals, industrial applications |

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Architecture & the Conceptual Model of Robot Control

This chapter introduces ROS 2 as the robot's nervous system, explaining nodes, topics, services, and actions through a powerful nervous system metaphor. You'll understand how humanoid robots coordinate dozens of processes for real-time control.

| [Explorer](./chapter-2-ros2-architecture-explorer) | Beginner | Software developers familiar with microservices |
| [Builder](./chapter-2-ros2-architecture-builder) | Intermediate | Makers with Arduino/Raspberry Pi experience |
| [Engineer](./chapter-2-ros2-architecture-engineer) | Advanced | Engineers familiar with industrial control systems |

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Robot Modeling with URDF

This chapter introduces URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) as the digital anatomy of a robot. You'll learn how robots understand their own structure through links, joints, kinematic chains, and transform trees—essential concepts for motion planning and sensor fusion.
