# Module 2: Digital Twin Technology

Welcome to Module 2! This module explores digital twin technology for robotics simulation, enabling you to design, test, and iterate on robotic systems in virtual environments before deploying to physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create digital twins of robotic systems
- Simulate robot behavior in virtual environments
- Bridge simulation and physical robots
- Use digital twins for testing and validation

## Chapters

Chapters will be added here as the curriculum develops.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
