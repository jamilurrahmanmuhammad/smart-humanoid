## Prompt

/sp.plan - Create implementation plan for restructuring docs from flat sibling structure (modules/, chapters/) to hierarchical module > chapter structure.

## Response snapshot

Created planning artifacts for feature 003-docs-structure-user-story-3:

1. **spec.md** - Feature specification defining:
   - Hierarchical module > chapter structure
   - 11 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-011)
   - Target directory structure with 4 modules
   - Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-006)

2. **plan.md** - Implementation plan including:
   - Technical context (Docusaurus 3.x, Playwright tests)
   - Constitution check (all gates passed)
   - Migration plan from current to target state
   - Definition of done checklist

3. **research.md** - Research findings:
   - Docusaurus sidebar generation (autogenerated from filesystem)
   - Module naming convention (kebab-case with number prefix)
   - Category configuration (_category_.json)
   - Chapter file naming convention

**Decision**: Skipped data-model.md and contracts/ - not applicable for filesystem restructuring task.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Planning artifacts created, ready for task generation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A - planning phase
- 📁 Files: 3 files created (spec.md, plan.md, research.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Data modeling phase appropriately skipped for simple filesystem restructuring

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial attempt to create data-model.md was unnecessary for this feature type
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation
