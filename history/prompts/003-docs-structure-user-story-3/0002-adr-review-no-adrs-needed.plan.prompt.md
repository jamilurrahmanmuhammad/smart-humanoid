## Prompt

/sp.adr - Review planning artifacts for architecturally significant decisions and create ADRs.

## Response snapshot

Analyzed plan.md for architectural decisions. Found decisions in:
- Content Hierarchy (Module > Chapter nesting)
- Sidebar Generation (Native Docusaurus autogenerated)
- Naming Convention (Kebab-case with number prefix)

Applied ADR significance test:
1. Impacts how engineers write/structure software? → Partial (content, not code)
2. Notable tradeoffs or alternatives? → Partial (flat vs hierarchical, flat already rejected)
3. Will be questioned or revisited later? → No (follows constitution XXXV)

**Result: No ADRs created**

Rationale:
- Feature implements content organization following established constitution
- Uses native Docusaurus features (no new technology)
- Decisions are implementation details, not architectural decisions

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Confirmed no architectural decisions require ADRs
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 0 ADRs created
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: ADR review correctly identified that content organization following constitution guidance doesn't warrant ADRs

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - correctly avoided over-granular ADRs
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Significance test FAIL (correctly - no ADRs needed)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation
