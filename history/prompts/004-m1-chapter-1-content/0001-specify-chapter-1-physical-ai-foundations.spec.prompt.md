## Prompt

/sp.specify lets start another feature specification for the first chapter contents of the book mentioned in the constituion. You can take the comprehensive idea that is provided by chatgpt at /mnt/c/mounted/chapter_1_specification_chatpt.txt and make sure that constituion is 100% followed as non negociable.

## Response snapshot

Created feature specification for Module 1 Chapter 1 - Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence:

1. **Branch Created**: `004-m1-chapter-1-content`

2. **Specification Contents**:
   - 6 User Stories covering: Physical AI concept, Embodied Intelligence, Perception-Action Loop, Physics Constraints, ROS 2 Foreshadowing, Hardware Awareness
   - 24 Functional Requirements organized by: Content, Narrative, Constitution Compliance, Metadata
   - 10 Success Criteria (all technology-agnostic and measurable)
   - Clear Scope with In/Out boundaries

3. **Constitution Compliance**:
   - All requirements explicitly reference constitution sections
